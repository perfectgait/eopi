# 8.1 Merge Two Sorted Lists
Let L and F be singly linked lists in which each node holds a number.  Assume the numbers in L and F appear in ascending
order within the lists.  The merge of L and F is a list consisting of the nodes of L and F in which numbers appear in
ascending order.

Write a program that takes L and F, and returns the merge of L and F.  Your code should reuse the nodes from the lists
provided as input.  Your program should use O(1) additional storage.  The only field you can change in a node is next.
