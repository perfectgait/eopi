# 6.18 Compute Spiral Order

An nxn 2D array of integers can be written as a sequence of integers in several orders - the most natural ones being
row-by-row or column-by-column.  In this problem we explore the problem of writing the 2D array in spiral order.

Write a function that takes a 2D array A and returns the spiral ordering of A.
