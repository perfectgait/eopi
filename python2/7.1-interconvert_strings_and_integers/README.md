# 7.1 Interconvert Strings and Integers
A string is a sequence of characters.  A string may encode an integer, e.g., "123" encodes 123.  In this problem, you
are to implement methods that take a string representing an integer and return the corresponding integer, and vice
versa.  Your code should handle negative integers.  You cannot use library functions.
