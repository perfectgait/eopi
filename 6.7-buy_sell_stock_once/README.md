# 6.7 Buy and Sell a Stock Once
This problem formalizes the problem of optimally buying and selling a stock.  As an example, consider the array 
[310, 315, 275, 295, 260, 270, 290, 230, 255, 250].  The maximum profit that can be made with one buy and one sell is
30 - buy at 260 and sell at 290.  Note that 260 is not the lowest price, nor 290 the highest price.

Write a program that takes an array of non-negative real numbers, denoting the daily stock price for a company, and
returns the maximum profit that could be made by buying and selling a single stock over that time period.
