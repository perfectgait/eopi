# 6.12 Sample Offline Data
Let A be an array whos entries are all distinct.  Implement an algorithm that takes A and an integer k and returns a
subset ok k elements of A.  All subsets should be equally likely.  Use as few calls to the random number generator
(which returns random integers) as possible and use O(1) additional storage.  You can return the result in the same
array as input.
