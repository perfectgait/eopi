#5.13 Get Rectangle Intersection
A rectangle whose sides are parallel to the X-axis and Y-axis can be represented by its left-most lower point(x,y),
width w and height h.  This problem is concerned with such rectangles.
Write a program which tests if two rectangles have a nonempty intersection.  If the intersection is nonempty, return the
rectangle formed by their intersection.
