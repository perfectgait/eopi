#6.20 Rotate a 2D Array
Image rotation is a fundamental operation in computer graphics.  The following illustrates a 90 degree clockwise
rotation:
[[1, 2, 3, 4]
[5, 6, 7, 8]
[9, 10, 11, 12]
[13, 14, 15, 16]]

[[13, 9, 5, 1]
[14, 10, 6, 2]
[15, 11, 7, 3]
[16, 12, 8, 4]]

Implement an algorithm to rotate A, an n x n 2D array, by 90 degrees clockwise.  Assume that n = 2^k for some positive
integer k.
