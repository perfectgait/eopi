#11.4 Compute the k Closest Stars
Consider a coordinate system for the Milky Way, in which Earth is at (0, 0, 0).  Model stars as points, and assume
distances are in light years.  the Milky Way consists of approximately 10^12 stars, and their coordinates are stored in
a file.
How would you compute the k stars which are closest to Earth?
