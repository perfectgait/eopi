#18.5 The 3-Sum Problem
Let A be an array of n numbers.  Let t be a number, and k be an integer
in [1, n].  Define A to k-create t if and only if there exists k indices
i0, i1, ..., ik-1 (not necessarily distinct) such that the sum equals t.

Design an algorithm that takes as input an array A and a number t, and
determines if A 3-creates t.
