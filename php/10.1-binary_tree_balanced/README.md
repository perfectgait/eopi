# 10.1 Test if a Binary Tree is Balanced
A binary tree is said to be balanced if for each node in the tree, the difference in the height of its left and right
sub-trees is at most one.  A perfect binary tree is balanced, as is a complete binary tree.  A balanced binary tree does
not have to be perfect or completed.

Write a program that takes as input the root of a binary tree and checks whether the tree is balanced.
