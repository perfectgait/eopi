#12.9 Find The k-th Largest Element
Many algorithms require as a subroutine the computation of the k-th largest element of an array.  The 1-st largest
element is simply the largest element.  The n-th largest element is the smallest element, where n is the length of the
array.
For example, if the input array A = [3, 2, 1, 5, 4], then A[3] is the 1st largest element in A, A[0] is the 3rd largest
element in A, and A[2] is the 5th largest element in A.
Design an algorithm for computing the k-th largest element in an array.  Assume entries are distinct.
