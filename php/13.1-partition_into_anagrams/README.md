# 13.1 Partition Into Anagrams
Anagrams are popular word play puzzles, where by rearranging letters of one set of words, you get another set of words.
For example, "eleven plus two" is an anagram for "twelve plus one."  Crossword puzzle enthusiasts and scrabble players
benefit from the ability to view all possible anagrams of a given set of letters.

Write a program that takes as input a set of words and returns groups of anagrams for those words.  For example, if the
input is "debitcard," "elvis," "silent," "badcredit," "lives," "freedom," "listen," "levis" then there are three groups
of anagrams:
1. "debitcard," "badcredit"
2. "elvis," "lives," "levis"
3. "silent," "listen"
