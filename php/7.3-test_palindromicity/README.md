#7.3 Test Palindromicity
For the purpose of this problem, define a palindromic string to be a string which when all the non alphanumeric
characters are removed it reads the same front to back ignoring case.  For example, "A man, a plane, a canal, Panama."
and "Able was I, ere I saw Elba!" are palindromic, but "Ray a ray" is not.
Implement a function which takes as input a string s and returns true if s is a palindromic string.
