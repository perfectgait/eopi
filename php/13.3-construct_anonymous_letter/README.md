#13.3 Is An Anonymous Letter Constructable?
A hash table can be viewed as a dictionary.  For this reason, hash tables commonly appear in string processing.

You are required to write a method which takes text for an anonymous letter and text for a magazine.  Your method is to
determine if it is possible to write the anonymous letter using the text from the magazine.  The anonymous letter can
be written from the magazine if for each character whether the number of times it appears in the anonymous letter is
less than or equal to the number of times it appears in the magazine.
