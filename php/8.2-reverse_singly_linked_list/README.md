#8.2 Reverse a Singly Linked List
Suppose you were given a singly linked list L of integers sorted in ascending order and you need to return a list with
the elements sorted in descending order.  Memory is scarce, but you can reuse nodes in the original list, i.e., your
function can change L.
Give a linear time non-recursive function that reverses a singly linked list.  The function should use no more than
constant storage beyond that needed for the list itself.
