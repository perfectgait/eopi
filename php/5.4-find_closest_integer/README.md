# 5.4 Find A Closest Integer With The Same Weight
Define the weight of a non-negative integer x to be the number of bits that are set to 1 in its binary representation.
For example, since 92 in base-2 equals(1011100), the weight of 92 is 4.
Write a program which takes as input a non-negative integer x and returns y != x such that y has the same weight as x,
and the difference of x and y is as small as possible.  You can assume x is not 0 or all 1's.
