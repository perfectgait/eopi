#5.11 Check If A Decimal Integer Is A Palindrome
A palindromic string is one which reads the same forwars and backwards, e.g. "redivider."  In this problem, you are to 
write a program which determines if the decimal representation of an integer is a palindromic string.  For example, your
program should return true on the inputs 0, 7, 11, 121, 333 and 2147447412, and false on the inputs -1, 12, 100 and
2147483647.
Write a program that takes an integer and determines if that integer's representation as a decimal string is a
palindrome.
