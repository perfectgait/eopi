# 5.5 Compute x * y Without Multiply Or Add
Often the processors in embedded systems do not have a hardware multiplier.  A program that needs to perform 
multiplication must do so explicitly.
Write a program that multiplies two non-negative integers.  The only operators you are allowed to use are assignment 
and the bitwise operators (i.e. >>, <<, |, & and ~.  You may use loops, conditionals and functions that you write
yourself.
